When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If you'd like to share your work with others or with the outside world.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    This adds one additional layer of control to make sure that whatever is pushed to other people and/or to the general public is ready for prime time.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork: quickly copy a project and make changes to it, giving credit to creator
    Clone: copy a project
    Branch: take a repository into another parallel direction

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Allows individuals to do separate work before merging with master on Github.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    It would be a lot of copying and pasting code and sending it around. Very difficult to stay organized.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Essentially allows you to quarantine your work, have it checked by somebody else, and then integrate it.
